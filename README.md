#A scraper for American Economy SSRN Assignment, Dr. Schachmurove

Temple University's faculty has it's fair share of characters, and just like no magical school would be complete without an evil potions professor, no undegraduate education worth its salt is without its self-important professor whose time is worth a lot more than yours. To what can only be this end, Temple University has provided Dr. Yochanan Scachmurove.

Every year, Dr. Scachmurove requires that student download all of his papers and do the "educational" task of copying-and-pasting his abstracts (and other meta-information) about his papers in order to bolster his download count. There is no work--or thought--involved. It's so mindless that a computer could do it!

This script retrieves the requested papers and writes them to an HTML document. Simply download the script, run it, and copy the output into a word file. While it runs, feel free to use your time doing something more edifying, such as watching paint dry.
